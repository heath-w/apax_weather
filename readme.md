# Apax Weather
Apax Weather was done by me as a coding challenge for Apax Software. The site allows a user to register and login accounts. They can search for locations using a wide range of inputs and covering most of the Earth. The user may save a location to always be viewed when navigating to the front page and they can delete saved locations they no longer wish to see.

# Technologies
## PHP 7.2 / Laravel 5.5
I selected PHP and Laravel for a few reasons.
⋅⋅* It was my most recent technologoes used for a full-stack web application.
⋅⋅* It is one of four technologies specifically listed as used by APAX Software's.
..* It was taught by (at least) the last two Bootcamps done by Awesome Inc U.

## Bootstrap 4
I selected Bootstrap 4 for three reasons.
..* I like the way it handles layouts.
..* It is well documented.
..* It has a solution for most everything I need to do.

## PostgreSQL
I selected PostgreSQL for three reasons.
..* I have experience in it.
..* It works well with my other technologies.
..* It is supported and free on Heroku.

# APIs
## Google Maps Geocoding API
I selected Google Maps Geocoding API because I wanted a robust way for people to input their location into the application. The API provided a very easy way to get a standard location from almost anything that a person could type in and covering most of the world. This API also has a high usage limit on their API requests.

## Yahoo Weather API
I selected Yahoo because it has a really interesting query language associated with it (YQL) and has a high usage limit on their API requests.

# Hosting/Remo
The code is stored on GitHub [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and hosted on [Heroku](https://apax-weather.heroku.com/).
A Gist is provided [here](https://www.github.com).

# Closing
This was a fun project. If I had more time I would do a few more things to it like better error-handling, moving the weather cards and some of their functionality to a JS framework (maybe Vue), try to optomize the number of API calls made, and do a better job of customizing the responsiveness of the layout.
